# No Fibbing

Sometimes you just need to check if a number is in the Fibonacci sequence. It happens to all of us from time to time. ðŸ˜‡

### To Run

- Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1919` on the command line.
- Go to `localhost:1919` in your favorite _modern_ browser.

### Special Thanks

Thanks to that Italian mathematician [Leonardo Bonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) a.k.a. Fibonacci.
